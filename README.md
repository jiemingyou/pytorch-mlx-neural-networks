# Basic Neural Networks using PyTorch and MLX

This repository contains the code for the basic neural networks implemented
side-by-side using PyTorch and MLX.

The code is not meant to be used in any serious applications, but rather a
simple comparison of the logic for building neural networks using PyTorch and
MLX.

The architectures of the neural networks are inspired by the CS-E4890 Deep
learning course at Aalto University.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── 01 [MODEL]            # Contains the specific model implementation
│   ├── [MODEL].py        # Code for training and testing the models
│   ├── [MODEL]_mlx.py    # Model implementation using MLX
│   ├── [MODEL]_torch.py  # Model implementation using PyTorch
```

## Models

- [x] Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
